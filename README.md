Simple Project to Scrape Email Adresses from Google, you need an input of a list of names.
I used it to help my friend find a flat in Berlin by mass writing to house owners. It worked ;))

### USAGE
add the path of your names txt file into line 55 of the code:
file_path = "YOUR_PATH_GOES_HERE"

The run:
